NAME
	ls â€“ list directory contents

USAGE
	ls [*directory*] [-a] [-color]

DESCRIPTION
	For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls
	displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For
	each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names
	of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested,
	associated information.

	If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are
	displayed.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are
	displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted
	separately and in lexicographical order.

	The following options are available:
	
	-a : shows hidden directories
	-color : colors every second elements, for better visibility
